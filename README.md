# Hansard Speaker Name Disambiguation

Digital methods are becoming increasingly important in the interpretation of the 19th-century British Parliamentary debates, also known as Hansard. Analyses of Hansard, however, can be thwarted by messy data. For this reason we present a preprocessing pipeline that produces the cleanest known version of the Hansard data. The final dataset produced by this pipeline can be downloaded [here](). 

Preprocessing the Hansard data is done in two major phases: 

- During phase I we scrape the Hansard data hosted by UK Parliament, transforming the raw XML files into a TSV file. We chose TSV because it is a popular file format used in computation. We discovered systemic issues in the XML tags while scraping the Hansard data. Debate text, for example, might be tagged as a debate title, while other sections might be missing tags in their entirety. For code that corrects these systematic issues and exports a clean TSV file, see [Bulk Import and Cleaning of Hansard XML Data](https://github.com/stephbuon/import_hansard_data).

- During phase II we disambiguate speakers. Even after correcting for systemtic issues in the data, accurate analysis of speakers was not possible because of ambiguities and inconsistencies in the names of MPs. This repository documents the problems associated with identifying the speakers of each sentence, and presents our pipeline for disambiguating speaker names by assigning a standardized name and unique ID to each speaker of a sentence.

### Issues Causing Ambiguous Speakers

We identify and correct 5 major issues that cause ambiguities in speaker names: 

1) Prolific members of parliament often held several office positions and the name of the MP who held a position is usually not mentioned. This problem becomes more pronounced in cases where a single MP held numerous offices. William Ewart Gladstone, for example, acted as Prime Minister four times, Chancellor of the Exchequer four times, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and President of the Board of Trade. The original XML usually only tags the position title (i.e. Prime Minister) as the full name of the speaker. 

2) A single name has several permutations. During a debate, William Ewart Gladstone might have been called William Gladstone, W. Gladstone, W. E. Gladstone, Wiliam E. Gladstone, and so forth. 

3) Several MPs shared the same name. Three different Parliamentarians, for example, were named Sir Robert Peel. In cases like this, metadata was collected to help make distinctions betweent the different speakers. Metadata may include the start and end dates of the different speakers named Sir Robert Peel. In other cases, some speakers share elements of their name, causing ambiguities. Mr Gladstone or Mr. W. Gladstone might refer to William Ewart Gladstone or Willaim Henry Gladstone. 

4) Many MP names have OCR errors. The original debates were hand-recorded with inkwell pens (check). Old handwriting can pose challenges for digitization. To add: many 19th-century debates were digitized and tagged using technology from the 1980s. While these early digitization efforts were important milestones for the production of the Hansard data, the output is rife with errors. 

5) Many MP names have inconsistent spellings. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, for example, might be transcribed as "Campbell Bannerman," or "Campbell - Bannerman."

To address the above issues, we have developed a speaker disambiguation pipeline that assigns a standardized name and unique ID to each speaker of a sentence. 

### About the Hansard Speaker Disambiguation Pipeline

We disambiguate speakers by: a) collecting metadata about MPs, and b) running our `hansard-speakers` algorithm. 

#### About the Data 

Our pipeline calls data from existing sets as well as o

(produces own -- generates permuataions and collect metadata). 

The existing data sets our pipeline uses are from: a) the [DiLPD project](https://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/4315/16/westminster-members.xml), and b) the [Andy Eggers and Arthur Spirling database](). 

These impressive and comprehensive data sets were foundational to (enter). However, they did not have the (standardization or identification) required for text mining speaker names. Therefore, we: a) generated permuations of speaker names within algorithm amd b) collected metadata to help disambiguate speaker names, such as metadata on (enter). (sources like Hansard People, etc.) Our metadata can be downloaded [here](). 

#### About the Algorithm

The algorithm works by (describe pipeline): 

- cleaning ocr errors in the mr etc. 
- removing certain types of titles
- generating permutations of speaker names 
- matching speakers (mention about corresponding ids) 
- using levenshtein distance to enter -- carefully and delibrerately applied to different subsections -- last names, office titles 




Thus we: 

generated permutations

Note that we hit less than 30 % (get exact number) even after I added permutations. Talk about that progression. 


### Comparison of our Data 






Speaker Name Inferences 

Even after collecting extensive metadata on (enter), (enter). (enter) a high number of conflicts where a

These conflicts make up (enter)% of our data. 


Therefore, we developed a set of assumptions

No I believe it is due to the position Gladstone had made for himself so he earned it out of respect I just checked and there does not seem to be any specific reason why a person is called right honorable. (So not synonymous with a position like prime minister)

He did not have a title so I guess in a way they gave him respect by adressing him like that

He is the only Gladstone who is called right honourable
